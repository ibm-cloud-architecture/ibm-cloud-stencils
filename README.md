# IBM Stencils

## Overview

Create IBM Diagrams with IBM Stencils using enterprise diagram tools.

<b><i>Note: This ibm1 icons github is being deprecated for enterprise diagram tools supported for ibm1 diagrams, and replaced with [ibm2 icons github](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/architecture-icons) for enterprise diagram tools supported for ibm2 diagrams.  If interested in diagram as code with Python for ibm2 diagrams, there is also the tool [ibmdiagrams](https://github.com/ibm/ibmdiagrams).</i></b>

2. To use the IBM Stencils on the [draw.io desktop application](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases) do the following:

   1. Open application and click on "+ More Shapes" in the bottom left panel.
   2. Scroll down to the "Networking" section and check "IBM".
   3. Click "Apply" to finish.

   IBM Stencils should now be available in the embedded categories in the left panel.
